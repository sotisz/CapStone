A Sprite Atlas has been created for the Tilesets to avoid seams/glitches.
If you do not want to have a Sprite Atlas for the Tilesets you can simply remove them and change the import settings of the Tilesets.
By setting the Filter Mode to Point (no filter) you will have no seams/glitches - however, this decreases the quality of the Tiles.
